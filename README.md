## Details

ganon is a tool designed to index large sets of genomic reference sequences and to classify short reads against them efficiently. Reads are classified and filtered based on shared k-mers or minimizers with a defined absolute error rate using the k-mer counting lemma (q-gram lemma) or a relative cutoff. The tool was mainly developed, but not limited, to the metagenomic classification problem: assign short fragments to their closest reference among thousands of references.

ganon can further:
 - use [minimizers](#minimizers-or-offset) to build small indices, use less memory and have faster classification 
 - [update indices](#updating-the-index) incrementally in a fraction of time used to built them
 - perform [hierarchical classification](#multiple-and-hierarchical-classification)
 - classify at strain or taxonomic level but also at a custom [specialization](#--specialization)
 - integrated NCBI taxonomy to build and classify
 - report the lowest common ancestor (LCA), multiple and unique matches 
 - generate reports and tables for multi-sample studies with many filtering options

ganon relies 3 external tools/libraries
 - [SeqAn3](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3) and the Interleaved Bloom Filter implementation
 - [TaxSBP](https://github.com/pirovc/taxsbp) to cluster sequences into taxonomic related groups
 - [genome_updater](https://github.com/pirovc/genome_updater) (optional) to download reference sequences 

ganon achieved very good results in [our own evaluations](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa458) but also in independent evaluations: [LEMMI](https://lemmi.ezlab.org/) and [CAMI2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.12.451567v1)

## Installation

[![install with bioconda](https://img.shields.io/badge/install%20with-bioconda-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/ganon/README.html)

```bash
conda install -c bioconda -c conda-forge ganon
```

* There are possible performance benefits compiling ganon from source rather than using the conda version. To do so, please follow the instructions: [Install without conda](#install-without-conda)

## Running ganon with sample data

### build

Create index/database from reference genomic sequences

```bash
ganon build --db-prefix sample_bacteria \
            --input-files tests/ganon/data/build/bacteria_*.fasta.gz \
            --taxdump-file tests/ganon/data/mini_nodes.dmp tests/ganon/data/mini_names.dmp \
            --seq-info-file tests/ganon/data/build/bacteria_seqinfo.txt
```

- `ganon build` (with a space in between) should be used and it is different from the `ganon-build` command
- `--taxdump-file` and `--seq-info-file` files are optional and will be automatically downloaded/generated if not provided
- To build a smaller filter that will enable very fast classification (at a small cost of sens./prec.), use minimizers:

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

```bash
ganon build --db-prefix sample_bacteria \
            --input-files tests/ganon/data/build/bacteria_*.fasta.gz \
            --taxdump-file tests/ganon/data/mini_nodes.dmp tests/ganon/data/mini_names.dmp \
            --seq-info-file tests/ganon/data/build/bacteria_seqinfo.txt \
            --window-size 32
```

  </details>

### classify

Classify reads against built index/database

```bash
ganon classify --db-prefix sample_bacteria --single-reads tests/ganon/data/bac.sim.1.fq -o sample_results
```

### report

Generate readable reports, with filter options

```bash
ganon report --db-prefix sample_bacteria --rep-file sample_results.rep \
             --min-percentage 0.5 --ranks all \
             --output-prefix new_report -f tsv
```

### table

Generate a rank table (e.g.: samples X species) from multiple reports, with filter options

```bash
ganon table -i sample_results.tre new_report.tre -o sample_table.tsv
```

### update

Update index/database adding and/or removing reference genomic sequences

```bash
ganon update --db-prefix sample_bacteria --output-db-prefix sample_bacteria_virus --input-files tests/ganon/data/update/virus_*.fasta.gz
```

## Building custom indices

To build custom indices, ganon requires one (or multiple) fasta file(s) with the standard NCBI accession.version header (e.g. `>NC_009515.1`). For every sequence, taxonomic information will be automatically retrieved. Check the parameter `--rank`, `--specialization` and `--seq-info`  for more information.

If you are working with sequences from a different source than NCBI, please provide a `--seq-info-file`.

### Downloading sequences and building a new index

We suggest using [genome_updater](https://github.com/pirovc/genome_updater) (`conda install -c bioconda genome_updater`) to download sequences from RefSeq/Genbank. genome_updater can download and keep a subset of those repositories updated. For example:

Downloading archaeal and bacterial complete genomes from RefSeq: 

```bash
genome_updater.sh -g "archaea,bacteria" \
                  -d "refseq" \
                  -l "Complete Genome" \
                  -f "genomic.fna.gz,assembly_report.txt" \
                  -o "RefSeqCG_arc_bac" -b "v1" \
                  -a -m -u -r -p -t 24
```
Where `-a` will additionally download the taxdump.tar.gz, `-m` will force the MD5 check for every file downloaded, `-u -r -p` will generate reports which can be used later, `-t` set the number of parallel downloads, `-b` will name the version and `-o` set the output working directory. It also possible to download references for specific taxonomic groups with genome_updater.

Building the index based on the files of the example above:

```bash
ganon build --db-prefix ganon_db \
            --input-files RefSeqCG_arc_bac/v1/files/*genomic.fna.gz
```

- If you are getting the bash error `Argument list too long` use `--input-directory "RefSeqCG_arc_bac/v1/files/" --input-extension "genomic.fna.gz"` instead of `--input-files`.
- To speed up the building process, consider [using extra files to build and update](#using-extra-files-to-build-and-update)

### Updating the index

To update the folder with the most recent releases (after some days), just re-run the same download command:

```bash
genome_updater.sh -g "archaea,bacteria" \
                  -d "refseq" \
                  -l "Complete Genome" \
                  -f "genomic.fna.gz,assembly_report.txt" \
                  -o "RefSeqCG_arc_bac" -b "v2" \
                  -a -m -u -r -p -t 24
```

This is now going to download the new files (and skip the outdated ones) into the new label `v2`. New log and report files with the current version will be generated. It also checks if the last downloaded version is complete and downloads any missing file.

Updating the index based on the files of the example above:

```bash
ganon update --db-prefix ganon_db --output-db-prefix ganon_db_updated \
             --input-files $(find RefSeqCG_arc_bac/v2/files/ -name *genomic.fna.gz -type f)
```

If `--output-db-prefix` is not set, the database files `ganon_db.*` will be overwritten with the updated version. The `find` command will only look for files `-type f` inside the `v2/files/`, ignoring symbolic links from sequences which were not changing in this version.

By default, `ganon update` will only add new sequences provided to the index. To perform a full update, also removing sequences for the index, use the option `--update-complete` and provide the full set of updated references instead of only the new sequences, as below:

```bash
ganon update --db-prefix ganon_db --output-db-prefix ganon_db_updated \
             --update-complete \
             --input-files RefSeqCG_arc_bac/v2/files/*genomic.fna.gz
```

### Using extra files to build and update

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

Optionally, some extra files generated by genome_updater can be further used to speed-up the building process:

```bash
# Extract taxonomic information from genome_updater reports
awk 'BEGIN {FS="\t";OFS="\t"}{if($4!="na"){ print $4,$5,$6,$2 }}' RefSeqCG_arc_bac/v1/updated_sequence_accession.txt > RefSeqCG_arc_bac/v1/seqinfo.txt

# Use generated files from genome_updater on ganon build
ganon build --db-prefix ganon_db \
            --input-files RefSeqCG_arc_bac/v1/files/*genomic.fna.gz \
            --seq-info-file RefSeqCG_arc_bac/v1/seqinfo.txt \
            --taxdump-file RefSeqCG_arc_bac/v1/{TIMESTAMP}_taxdump.tar.gz
```

The same goes for the update process:

```bash
# Extract taxonomic information from genome_updater reports
awk 'BEGIN {FS="\t";OFS="\t"}{if($1=="A" && $4!="na"){ print $4,$5,$6,$2 }}' RefSeqCG_arc_bac/v2/updated_sequence_accession.txt > RefSeqCG_arc_bac/v2/seqinfo.txt

# Use generated files on ganon update
ganon update --db-prefix ganon_db \
             --output-db-prefix ganon_db_updated \
             --input-files $(find RefSeqCG_arc_bac/v2/files/ -name *genomic.fna.gz -type f) \
             --seq-info-file RefSeqCG_arc_bac/v2/seqinfo.txt \
             --taxdump-file RefSeqCG_arc_bac/v2/{TIMESTAMP}_taxdump.tar.gz
```

Obs:
-  If `-d genbank` was used in genome_updater, change the occurrences of `$4` to `$3` in the `awk` commands above.
- `{TIMESTAMP}` should be the timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS) automatically generated when the files were downloaded.

</details>

## Output files

### build/update

Every run on `ganon build` or `ganon update` will generate the following database files:

 - {prefix}**.ibf**: main interleaved bloom filter file
 - {prefix}**.map**: tab-separated mapping between targets and bin identifiers. Targets should be present in the .tax file as a node *(fields: target, bin id)*
 - {prefix}**.tax**: taxonomic tree *(fields: target/node, parent, rank, name)*
 - {prefix}**.gnn**: gzipped pickled file (python) with information about clustering and parameters used

Obs:
-  Database files generated with version 1.0.0 or higher are not compatible with older versions.

### classify
 
 - {prefix}**.rep**: plain report of the run with only targets that received a match *(fields: 1) hierarchy_label, 2) target, 3) total matches, 4) unique reads, 5) lca reads, 6) rank, 7) name)*. At the end prints 2 extra lines with `#total_classified` and `#total_unclassified`
 - {prefix}**.lca**: output with one match for each classified read after LCA. Only generated with `--output-lca` active. If multiple hierarchy levels are set, one file for each level will be created: {prefix}.{hierarchy}.lca *(fields: read identifier, target, (max) k-mer count)*
 - {prefix}**.all**: output with all matches for each read. Only generated with `--output-all` active **Warning: file can be very large**. If multiple hierarchy levels are set, one file for each level will be created: {prefix}.{hierarchy}.all *(fields: 1) read identifier, 2) target, 3) k-mer count)*
  - {prefix}**.tre**: report file (see below)

### report

 - {prefix}**.tre**: tab-separated tree-like report with cumulative counts and taxonomic lineage. By default, this is a read-based report where each read classified is counted once. It is possible to generate this for all read matches (`ganon report --report-type matches`). In this case, single and shared matches are reported to their target. Each line in this report is a taxonomic entry, with the following fields: 

  1) taxonomic rank *(e.g. phylum, species, ...)*
  2) target *(e.g. taxid/specialization)*
  3) target lineage *(e.g 1|2|1224|...)*
  4) target name *(e.g. Paenibacillus polymyxa)*
  5) \# unique assignments *(number of reads that matched exclusively to this target)*
  6) \# shared assignments *(number of reads with non-unique matches directly assigned to this target. Represents the lca matches (`--report-type reads`) or shared matches (`--report-type matches`))*
  7) \# children assignments *(number of reads assigned to all children nodes of this target)*
  8) \# cumulative assignments *(the sum of the unique, shared and children reads/matches assigned up-to this target)*
  9) \% cumulative assignments

- Using `--report-type reads` the first line of the file will show the number of unclassified reads

- The sum of cumulative assignments for the unclassified and root lines should be 100%. The final cumulative sum of reads/matches may be under 100% if any filter is successfully applied and/or hierarchical selection is selected (keep/skip/split).

- When `--report-type reads` only taxa that received direct read matches, either unique or through lca, are considered. Some reads may have only shared matches and will not be reported directly (but will be accounted on some parent level). To look at those matches you can create a report with `--report-type matches` or look at the file {prefix}**.rep**.

### table

 - {output_file}: a tab-separated file with counts/percentages of taxa for multiple samples
 
### Examples of output files

The main output file is the `{prefix}.tre` which will summarize the results:

## Multiple and Hierarchical classification

Ganon classification can be performed in multiple databases at the same time. The databases can also be provided in a hierarchical order. 

Multiple database classification can be performed providing several inputs for `--db-prefix`. They are required to be built with the same `--kmer-size` and `--window-size` values. Multiple databases are considerer as if they were one (built together) and redundancy in content (same reference in two or more databases) is allowed.

To classify reads in a hierarchical order, `--hierarchy-labels` should be provided. When using multiple hierarchical levels, output files will be generated for each level (use `--output-single` to generate a single output from multiple hierarchical levels). Please note that some parameters are set for each database (e.g. `--abs-cutoff`) while others are set for each hierarchical level (e.g. `--abs-filter`)

For example: 

### Classifying reads against multiple databases:

```bash
ganon classify --db-prefix db1 db2 db3 \
               --rel-cutoff 0.75 \
               -r reads.fq.gz
```

Classification against 3 database (as if they were one) using the same cutoff.

### Classifying reads against multiple databases with different cutoffs:

```bash
ganon classify --db-prefix db1 db2 db3 \
               --abs-cutoff  0   1   4 \
               -r reads.fq.gz
```

Classification against 3 database (as if they were one) using different error rates for each.

### Classifying reads against multiple databases hierarchically:

```bash
ganon classify --db-prefix            db1     db2      db3 \
               --hierarchy-labels 1_first 1_first 2_second \
               -r reads.fq.gz
```

In this example, reads are going to be classified first against db1 and db2. Reads without a valid match will be further classified against db3. `--hierarchy-labels` are strings and are going to be sorted to define the hierarchy order, disregarding input order.

### Classifying reads against multiple databases hierarchically with different cutoffs:

```bash
ganon classify --db-prefix            db1     db2      db3 \
               --hierarchy-labels 1_first 1_first 2_second \
               --rel-cutoff             1     0.5     0.25 \
               --abs-filter             0                1 \
               -r reads.fq.gz
```

In this example, classification will be performed with different `--rel-cutoff` for each database. For each hierarchy levels (`1_first` and `2_second`) a different `--abs-filter` will be used.

## Choosing/explaining parameters

### ganon classify

#### --single-reads and/or --paired-reads

ganon accepts single-end and paired-end reads. Both types can be use at the same time. In paired-end mode, reads are always reported with the header of the first pair. Paired-end reads are classified in a standard forward-reverse orientation. The max. read length accepted is 65535 (accounting both reads in paired mode).

#### cutoff and filter (--abs-cutoff, --rel-cutoff, --abs-filter, --rel-filter)

ganon has two parameters to control a match between reads and references: `cutoff` and `filter`. Both can be used with absolute values (`--abs-cutoff` and `--abs-filter`) or relative values (`--rel-cutoff` and `--rel-filter`) interchangeably. They can also be disabled.

Every read can be classified against none, one or more references. What will be reported is the remaining matches after `cutoff` and `filter` thresholds are applied, based on the number of shared k-mers (or minimizers) between sequences.

The `cutoff` is the first. It should be set as a minimal value to consider a match between a read and a reference. Next the `filter` is applied to the remaining matches. `filter` thresholds are relative to the best scoring match. Here one can control how far from the best match we want to allow further matches. `cutoff` can be interpreted as the lower bound to discard spurious matches and `filter` as the fine tuning to control what to keep.

For example:

Using `--kmer-size 19`, a certain read (100bp) has the following matches with the 5 references (`ref1..5`), sorted by shared k-mers:

| reference | shared k-mers |
|-----------|---------------|
| ref1      | 82            |
| ref2      | 68            |
| ref3      | 44            |
| ref4      | 25            |
| ref5      | 20            |

this read can have at most 82 shared k-mers (`100-19+1=82`). With `--rel-cutoff 0.25`, the following matches will be discarded:

| reference | shared k-mers | --rel-cutoff 0.25 |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| ref1      | 82            |                   |
| ref2      | 68            |                   |
| ref3      | 44            |                   |
| ref4      | 25            |                   |
| ~~ref5~~  | ~~20~~        | X                 |

since the `--rel-cutoff` threhsold is `82 * 0.25 = 21` (ceiling is applied). Further, with `--abs-filter 1`, the following matches will be discarded:

| reference | shared k-mers | --rel-cutoff 0.75 | --abs-filter 1 |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| ref1      | 82            |                   |                |
| ref2      | 68            |                   |                |
| ~~ref3~~  | ~~44~~        |                   | X              |
| ~~ref4~~  | ~~25~~        |                   | X              |
| ~~ref5~~  | ~~20~~        | X                 |                |


since best match is 82 (0 errors), the filter parameter is allowing +1 error (the represents 63 to 81 shared k-mers). The error numbers are calculated using the q-gram lemma.

Currently, databases built with `--window-size` will only work with relative values. In this case, the relative values are not based on the maximum number of possible shared k-mers but on the actual number of unique minimizers extracted from the read.

Using absolute values for `cutoff` and `filter` is advised, since they will incorporate stricter boundaries defined by the q-gram lemma into your results. However, if your input consists of reads of different lengths, the use of `--rel-cutoff` is advised, since the absolute number of error in sequences of different sizes have different meanings. Note that in this case the use of `--abs-filter` is still possible and advised to better select matches based on the q-gram lemma.

A different `cutoff` can be set for every database in a multiple or hierarchical database classification. A different `filter` can be set for every level of a hierarchical database classification.

Note that reads that remain with only one reference match (before or after `cutoff` and `filter` are applied) are considered a unique match.

#### minimizers or offset

`--window-size` or `--offset` can be used to speed-up analysis and reduce memory usage at the cost of sensitivity/precision on classification.

`--window-size` can be set with `ganon build` to activate the use of minimizers. It produces smaller database files and requires substantially less memory overall. It may increase building times but will have a huge benefit for classification times. We experience a 6x decrease in memory usage and 6x speed-up on classification (`--window-size 32 --kmer-size 19`). Sensitivity and precision were reduced by small margins. `--window-size` has to be greater or equal `--kmer-size`.

`--offset` can be set on (>1) and off (1) with `ganon classify` (for databases built without `--window-size`) . `--offset n` will only evaluate every nth k-mer of the input sequences. In our experiments, lower `--offset` values (e.g. 2,3,4) will drastically reduce running times on classification with very low impact on the sensitivity and precision of the results. `--offset` has to be smaller or equal `--kmer-size`.

### ganon build 

#### --max-filter-size and --bin-length 

The most useful variable to define the IBF size (.ibf file) is the `--max-filter-size`. It will set an approximate upper limit size for the file and estimate the `--bin-length` size based on it. However, there is a minimum size necessary to generate the filter given a set of references and chosen parameters. When using `--window-size`, the final filter size may be significantly smaller than calculated, depending on how similar are reference sequences in your dataset.

<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>

The IBF size is defined mainly on the amount of the input reference sequences (`-i`) but also can also be adjusted by a combination of parameters. Ganon will try to find the best `--bin-length` given `--max-fp`. Increasing `--max-fp` will generate smaller filters, but will generate more false positives in the classification step. If you know what you are doing, you can also directly set the size of the IBF with `--filter-size`.

`--bin-length` is the size in base pairs of each group for the taxonomic clustering (with TaxSBP). By default, `--fragment-length` will be the size of `--bin-length` - `--overlap-length`, meaning that sequences will be split with overlap to fit into the bins. For example: species X has 2 sequences of 120bp each. Considering `--bin-length 50` and `--overlap-length 10` (`--fragment-length 40` consequently) each of the sequences will be split into 50bp and put into a bin with overlap of 10bp, resulting in 3 bins for each sequence (6 in total for species X).

Such adjustment is necessary to equalize the size of each bin, since the IBF requires the individual bloom filters to be of the same size by definition. Building the IBF based on the biggest sequence group in your references will generate the lowest number of bins but a very sparse and gigantic IBF. Building the IBF based on the smallest sequence group in your references will generate the smallest IBF but with too many bins. A balance between those two is necessary to achieve small and fast filters.

#### --specialization

With the `--specialization` parameter is possible use an extra specialized "rank" as target for classification after taxonomic leaves. With this option, classification can be performed at strain, assembly, file, sequence level or any other custom level. `--specialization sequence` will use each each sequence (starting with ">") in the provided input files as a unique target to build the database. `--specialization file` will use each file as a target, useful for building at assembly/strain level if all sequences of the same group are in one file. `--specialization assembly` will retrieve assembly accessions from NCBI eutils and use them as target (this can take some time, since NCBI web services are limited on the amount of request per second). `--specialization custom` will use the 4th column of the `--seq-info-file` as target, allowing customized specializations.

### ganon update

#### --update-complete

By default `ganon update` will only add sequences provided with `--input-files` to an previously generated index. Using `--update-complete` it is possible to add and remove sequences from an index. When activating this option, ganon will consider that the files provided in `--input-files` are an actual representation of the index to build. It will automatically detect sequences that should be kept, inserted or removed given the input files and the information contained on the index to be updated.

#### --specialization

The same use of `--specialization` from `ganon build` (check above). `--specialization` can be changed in the update process (e.g. `--specialization assembly` was used to build and `--specialization file` is used to update). However, `--specialization` can only be used in `ganon update` if the database was built with it.

### ganon report

#### --report-type

By default, `ganon classify` and  `ganon report` generate a read-based report (`ganon report --report-type reads`) where each read classified is counted once, either to its unique or lca assignment. It is possible to generate the same report for all read matches (`ganon report --report-type matches`). In this case, multiple matches for each reads are reported to their targets (single or shared matches). Using `--report-type matches` will not show the unclassified number of reads and it will always sum up to 100% in the root node, since this reports the overall distribution of matches and not the amount of reads classified.

#### --split-hierarchy, --keep-hierarchy or --skip-hierarchy

When using multiple databases in different hierarchical levels to classify reads, it is possible to report them separately using `--split-hierarchy`. Once activated, one report will be generated for each hierarchical label. It is also possible to select or ignore specific hierarchical labels (e.g. for a label use for host removal) using `--keep-hierarchy` or `--skip-hierarchy`.
